**Map reality, not aspiration.**

ContextFlow is a visual DD context mapper for analyzing bounded contexts, their relationships, and code ownership across two synchronized views: **Flow** (value stream) and **Strategic** (Wardley evolution).

## What is ContextFlow?

ContextFlow helps teams map and edit their system architecture as it actually exists — not as the slide deck says it should be. It captures:

- **Bounded contexts** with strategic classification (core/supporting/generic), boundary integrity (strong/moderate/weak), and visual properties
- **DDD relationship patterns** between contexts (customer-supplier, conformist, anti-corruption layer, open-host service, shared kernel, partnership, etc.)
- **Code ownership** linking repositories to contexts and teams via drag-and-drop
- **Team topology** connecting teams to their boards and responsibilities
- **Capability groups** as visual clusters of related contexts

The key differentiator: **two views of the same system**.

### Flow View
Shows how value and data move left-to-right through your system (stages are configurable per project: e.g., "Discovery → Selection → Purchase → Fulfillment → Post-Sale" for e-commerce, or "Ingest → Normalize → Analyze → Publish" for data pipelines)

![Flow View](docs/context-flow-1.png)

### Strategic View
Shows where each capability sits on the Wardley evolution axis (Genesis → Custom-built → Product/Rental → Commodity/Utility)

![Strategic View](docs/context-flow-2.png)

Switch between views live. Same contexts, same relationships — different conversations.

## Why ContextFlow?

### Map reality, not aspiration

Most architecture diagrams show the system you wish you had. ContextFlow helps you map:
- Bounded contexts as they actually exist in your codebase
- DDD strategic patterns with upstream/downstream power dynamics
- Which teams own which repos, and where ownership is unclear
- Boundary integrity — because not all context boundaries are created equal

### Two views of the same system

**Flow View** resonates with delivery teams and product owners: "Here's how work moves across our pipeline."

**Strategic View** resonates with leadership and architects: "Here's what's core vs commodity, where we're exposed, and what we should buy vs build."

Both views use the same underlying model. That's the unlock.

### Built for practitioners

- Browser-based, no backend required
- Import/export as JSON
- Drag repos onto contexts, link teams to boards
- Full editing: drag nodes, create relationships, organize into groups
- Autosave with undo/redo for structural changes
- Light/dark theme support
- Designed for DDD facilitators, platform architects, and teams doing strategic design

## Features

**Current:**
- Visual canvas with pan/zoom and fit-to-map
- Bounded context nodes with strategic classification, boundary integrity, size, legacy/external badges
- DDD relationship patterns rendered as directed edges with pattern-specific styling
- Flow View with configurable value stream stages
- Strategic View with Wardley evolution bands
- Live view switching with animated transitions
- Full editing capabilities:
  - Drag nodes to reposition (updates per-view coordinates)
  - Multi-select and group drag with maintained relative positions
  - Edit context properties (name, purpose, classification, boundary integrity, notes)
  - Create/delete relationships with drag-to-connect workflow
  - Create/delete capability groups (translucent hulls)
- Repo sidebar with drag-to-assign functionality
- Team and ownership details with clickable Jira board links
- Inspector panel for editing context/relationship/group details
- Undo/redo for structural changes (add/move/delete context, relationships, repo assignments, groups)
- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- Project autosave (localStorage)
- Import/export project JSON

**Planned:**
- Multi-project picker (Miro-style recent boards)
- IndexedDB persistence for better performance
- Enhanced import/export options

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and opens the app in your browser.

The demo loads `examples/sample.project.json` — an ACME E-Commerce platform with 20 contexts, external services (Stripe, shipping carriers, fraud detection), and realistic DDD relationship patterns.

**Try it out:**
- Toggle between Flow and Strategic views
- Click a context to inspect and edit details
- Drag repos from the left sidebar onto contexts
- Multi-select contexts (Shift+click) and drag as a group
- Create relationships by dragging from one context to another
- Your changes autosave to localStorage

## Project Structure

- `src/` – React app code (TypeScript + Vite)
- `src/model/` – Core types and Zustand store
- `examples/` – Demo project data (`sample.project.json`, `cbioportal.project.json`)
- `docs/` – [VISION.md](docs/VISION.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md), [PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md)

## Project Status

**Beta.** Milestones 1-3 complete (Flow View, Strategic View, editing, repos, teams, groups). Ready for field testing with real projects.

See [PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) for the full roadmap.
